Assembly tips

1. Observe polarity when installing the LEDs, microcontroller, electrolytic capacitor, and when connecting the batteries to the terminal block (red wire is +, black is -).

2. Location of the terminal block and battery holder is flexible depending on your intended use and installation of the board.  I put the terminal block and the battery holder on the back side of the circuit board, using a one-inch square of double-stick foam tape to fasten the battery holder about 0.25 inch (6mm) from the bottom of the board.  This allows it to stand up at a slight angle on my desk.

3. There are four holes in the circuit board near the terminal block.  These can be used as strain reliefs for the battery wires by threading the wires through the holes.  Where you locate the battery holder, whether you use the strain relief holes, and how long you leave the wires from the battery holder all depend on your personal preference and installation.
