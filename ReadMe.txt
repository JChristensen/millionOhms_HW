Million Ohms Project Hardware
Jack Christensen
V1.1 Oct-2011

Right now this repository only contains the Eagle files and a parts list, no real assembly instructions.  I will post brief assembly instructions later, but the project is very simple and anyone who has even one or two very simple soldering projects under their belt should be able to build it easily.  See the parts list for a couple tips.

A bill of materials is available at:
